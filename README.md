# QnA-Service-PlugnPlay

This project is intended to behave as an IP that can be used to deploy a QnA Service onto any Azure subscription for free.
It just takes about 10 minutes to have your personalized QnA Bot up and running.

This project has 3 parts:
1. Backend where the QnA Knowledge Base service is hosted for which we utilize Azure.
2. GitHub Repository FAQ files are utlized to update the QnA service knowledge base automatically.
3. Frontend where you can interact with the QnA service, which in our case in GitHub Issues Bot & Azure Bot Service

The Architecture is described in the diagram below:
